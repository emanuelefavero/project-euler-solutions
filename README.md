# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

> **Note:** I have solved these problems in JavaScript

### What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

### How to run the solutions?

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `solutions` folder
3. Run the solution file using Node.js

```bash
node <problem_number>.js
```

> **Tip:** You can also use `nodemon` to automatically restart the Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected. Run `npm install -g nodemon` to install `nodemon` globally on your system and then `nodemon <problem_number>.js` to run the solution

## Problems
